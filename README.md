# Jenkins Windows Slave
This repo provide a Windows image that will work with [Docker Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Docker+Plugin) soon

The provided script `start_slave.ps1` should not be used in standalone because the Docker Plugin will use his own script. It could be used for test.

Many thanks to [@Thitho007](https://github.com/Thitho007) for his precious help
